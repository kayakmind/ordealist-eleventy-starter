Summer is one of the best times for camping. Unfortunately, the heat can turn your tent or camper into an oven. This is where a tent fan can save the day -- and night.

A good camping fan can help to keep your tent or camper cool, making it a must-have camping gear for those camping or overlanding in hot weather. In this guide, we’ll cover the factors to consider when looking for the best tent fan and highlight some of our favorite options.

## **How to Choose a Tent Fan**

It is not easy to choose a tent fan for camping as, frankly, they can all start to look the same. To help you better discern the differences, here are a few factors to keep in mind.



### **Construction**

As you will mainly be using your camping fan outdoors, it is wise to go for a model that is well-constructed and intended for rugged use. Buying a solidly-constructed fan will be cost-effective in the long-run since you will not need to spend money on a new one in the near future.

### **Cooling capacity of the fan**

Another important factor to consider when buying a tent fan is its cooling capacity. This way, you will know whether or not it will effectively cool your tent. Some tents will list the amount of air they move as cubic feet per minute (CFM). While nothing is set in stone, look for larger CFM rated fans for big tents and vice versa.

### **Portability**

Overlanding and camping gear should be highly portable, and a tent fan is no exception. In addition to being lightweight, a tent fan should also be compact enough to fit in your camping bag. Ideally, it should also have a carry handle or hooks that make it easy to lift and carry.

### **Safety**

For fans to move a great deal of air, their blades must be rotating at high speeds. This means that if you accidentally insert your fingers through the rotating grills when the fan is at top speeds, you will suffer serious injuries. Consider going for models with tight spacing between the grills that do not permit a finger to fit through, or go for one that has a mesh covering. This is particularly important if you have kids in tow.

### **Ease of usage**

Look for a fan that is easy to set up and mount and makes it easy to switch out batteries. A fan with LED can make it easier for one to use as a nightlight. A hanging hook allows you to hang the fan from the tent ceiling, which can be particularly nice if you want to use it while you are laying down.

### **Noise level**

You don't want to buy a ten fan that makes too much noise, as this can ruin your relaxing moments. If you can find the information, look for fans with a maximum noise level of no more than 50 decibels. The fans we've picked in this list are all very quiet and should be fine for camping.

## **Our Picks for the Best Tent Fans**

The following fans cover a range of air moving capacities and price points, with an eye to the factors we mentioned above.
